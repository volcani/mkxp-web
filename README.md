mkxp is a project that seeks to provide a fully open source implementation of the Ruby Game Scripting System (RGSS) interface used in the popular game creation software "RPG Maker XP", "RPG Maker VX" and "RPG Maker VX Ace" (trademark by Enterbrain, Inc.), with focus on Linux. The goal is to be able to run games created with the above software natively without changing a single file.

It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2+.

## Prebuilt binaries
[**Linux (32bit/64bit)**](http://ancurio.bplaced.net/mkxp/generic/)
[**OSX**](https://app.box.com/mkxpmacbuilds) by Ali
[**Windows (mingw-w64 32bit)**](http://ancurio.bplaced.net/mkxp/mingw32/)

## Should I use mkxp
mkxp primarily targets technically versed users that are comfortable with Ruby / RGSS, and ideally know how to compile the project themselves. The reason for this is that for most games, due to Win32-API usage, mkxp is simply not a plug-and-play solution, but a building block with which a fully cross-platform version can be created in time.

## Bindings
Bindings provide the glue code for an interpreted language environment to run game scripts in. Currently there are three bindings:

### MRI
Website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

Matz's Ruby Interpreter, also called CRuby, is the most widely deployed version of ruby. If you're interested in running games created with RPG Maker XP, this is the one you should go for. MRI 1.8 is what was used in RPG Maker XP, however, this binding is written against 2.0 (the latest version). For games utilizing only the default scripts provided by Enterbrain, this binding works quite well so far. Note that there are language and syntax differences between 1.8 and 2.0, so some user created scripts may not work correctly.

For a list of differences, see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21574/what-is-the-difference-between-ruby-1-8-and-ruby-1-9

This binding supports RGSS1, RGSS2 and RGSS3.

### mruby (Lightweight Ruby)
Website: https://github.com/mruby/mruby

mruby is a new endeavor by Matz and others to create a more lightweight, spec-adhering, embeddable Ruby implementation. You can think of it as a Ruby version of Lua.

Due to heavy differences between mruby and MRI as well as lacking modules, running RPG Maker games with this binding will most likely not work correctly. It is provided as experimental code. You can eg. write your own ruby scripts and run them.

Some extensions to the standard classes/modules are provided, taking the RPG Maker XP helpfile as a quasi "reference". These include Marshal, File, FileTest and Time.

This binding only supports RGSS1.

**Important:** If you decide to use [mattn's oniguruma regexp gem](https://github.com/mattn/mruby-onig-regexp), don't forget to add `-lonig` to the linker flags to avoid ugly symbol overlaps with libc.

### null
This binding only exists for testing purposes and does nothing (the engine quits immediately). It can be used to eg. run a minimal RGSS game loop directly in C++.

## Dependencies / Building

* Boost.Unordered (headers only)
* Boost.Program_options
* libsigc++ 2.0
* PhysFS (latest hg)
* OpenAL
* SDL2*
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_ttf
* [my SDL_sound fork](https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_sound)
* vorbisfile
* pixman
* zlib (only ruby bindings)
* OpenGL header (alternatively GLES2 with `DEFINES+=GLES2_HEADER`)
* libiconv (on Windows, optional with INI_ENCODING)
* libguess (optional with INI_ENCODING)

(* For the F1 menu to work correctly under Linux/X11, you need latest hg + [this patch](https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2745))

mkxp employs Qt's qmake build system, so you'll need to install that beforehand. Alternatively, you can build with cmake (FIXME: add cmake instructions).

qmake will use pkg-config to locate the respective include/library paths. If you installed any dependencies into non-standard prefixes, make sure to adjust your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable accordingly.

The exception is boost, which is weird in that it still hasn't managed to pull off pkg-config support (seriously?). *If you installed boost in a non-standard prefix*, you will need to pass its include path via `BOOST_I` and library path via `BOOST_L`, either as direct arguments to qmake (`qmake BOOST_I="/usr/include" ...`) or via environment variables. You can specify a library suffix (eg. "-mt") via `BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX` if needed.

Midi support is enabled by default and requires fluidsynth to be present at runtime (not needed for building); if mkxp can't find it at runtime, midi playback is disabled. It looks for `libfluidsynth.so.1` on Linux, `libfluidsynth.dylib.1` on OSX and `fluidsynth.dll` on Windows, so make sure to have one of these in your link path. If you still need fluidsynth to be hard linked at buildtime, use `CONFIG+=SHARED_FLUID`. When building fluidsynth yourself, you can disable almost all options (audio drivers etc.) as they are not used. Note that upstream fluidsynth has support for sharing soundfont data between synthesizers (mkxp uses multiple synths), so if your memory usage is very high, you might want to try compiling fluidsynth from git master.

By default, mkxp switches into the directory where its binary is contained and then starts reading the configuration and resolving relative paths. In case this is undesired (eg. when the binary is to be installed to a system global, read-only location), it can be turned off by adding `DEFINES+=WORKDIR_CURRENT` to qmake's arguments.

To auto detect the encoding of the game title in `Game.ini` and auto convert it to UTF-8, build with `CONFIG+=INI_ENCODING`. Requires iconv implementation and libguess. If the encoding is wrongly detected, you can set the "titleLanguage" hint in mkxp.conf.

**MRI-Binding**: pkg-config will look for `ruby-2.1.pc`, but you can override the version with `MRIVERSION=2.2` ('2.2' being an example). This is the default binding, so no arguments to qmake needed (`BINDING=MRI` to be explicit).

**MRuby-Binding**: place the "mruby" folder into the project folder and build it first. Add `BINDING=MRUBY` to qmake's arguments.

**Null-Binding**: Add `BINDING=NULL` to qmake's arguments.

### Supported image/audio formats
These depend on the SDL auxiliary libraries. For maximum RGSS compliance, build SDL2_image with png/jpg support, and SDL_sound with oggvorbis/wav/mp3 support.

To run mkxp, you should have a graphics card capable of at least **OpenGL (ES) 2.0** with an up-to-date driver installed.

## Dependency kit

To facilitate hacking, I have assembled a package containing all dependencies to compile mkxp on a bare-bones Ubuntu 12.04 64bit installation. Compatibility with other distributions has not been tested. You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mtp44ur367m2zts/mkxp-depkit.tar.xz). Read the "README" for instructions.

## Configuration

mkxp reads configuration data from the file "mkxp.conf". The format is ini-style. Do *not* use quotes around file paths (spaces won't break). Lines starting with '#' are comments. See 'mkxp.conf.sample' for a list of accepted entries.

All option entries can alternatively be specified as command line options. Any options that are not arrays (eg. RTP paths) specified as command line options will override entries in mkxp.conf. Note that you will have to wrap values containing spaces in quotes (unlike in mkxp.conf).

The syntax is: `--<option>=<value>`

Example: `./mkxp --gameFolder="my game" --vsync=true --fixedFramerate=60`

## Midi music

mkxp doesn't come with a soundfont by default, so you will have to supply it yourself (set its path in the config). Playback has been tested and should work reasonably well with all RTP assets.

You can use this public domain soundfont: [GMGSx.sf2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxdvoxxcexsvn43/GMGSx.sf2?dl=0)

## Fonts

In the RMXP version of RGSS, fonts are loaded directly from system specific search paths (meaning they must be installed to be available to games). Because this whole thing is a giant platform-dependent headache, I decided to implement the behavior Enterbrain thankfully added in VX Ace: loading fonts will automatically search a folder called "Fonts", which obeys the default searchpath behavior (ie. it can be located directly in the game folder, or an RTP).

If a requested font is not found, no error is generated. Instead, a built-in font is used (currently "Liberation Sans").

## What doesn't work (yet)

* Movie playback
* wma audio files
* The Win32API ruby class (for obvious reasons)
* Creating Bitmaps with sizes greater than the OpenGL texture size limit (around 8192 on modern cards)*

\* There is an exception to this, called *mega surface*. When a Bitmap bigger than the texture limit is created from a file, it is not stored in VRAM, but regular RAM. Its sole purpose is to be used as a tileset bitmap. Any other operation to it (besides blitting to a regular Bitmap) will result in an error.

## Nonstandard RGSS extensions

To alleviate possible porting of heavily Win32API reliant scripts, I have added certain functionality that you won't find in the RGSS spec. Currently this amounts to the following:

* The `Input.press?` family of functions accepts three additional button constants: `::MOUSELEFT`, `::MOUSEMIDDLE` and `::MOUSERIGHT` for the respective mouse buttons.
* The `Input` module has two additional functions, `#mouse_x` and `#mouse_y` to query the mouse pointer position relative to the game screen.
* The `Graphics` module has two additional properties: `fullscreen` represents the current fullscreen mode (`true` = fullscreen, `false` = windowed), `show_cursor` hides the system cursor inside the game window when `false`.

## Porting games to work with mruby+wasm

You can view a full example of a Scripts.rxdata diff for the Knight Blade sample game [here](extra/Scripts.rb.diff) (generated using [this](https://gist.github.com/pulsejet/6cb547db7222a65b32f34499c7266c36))

mruby has mutliple differences with MRI, and so games may not work as expected when porting to the web. The `extra/vm.c.patch` takes care of differing behavior during integer division, but you will need to make at least the following changes in your `Scripts.rxdata` for the game to work correctly and with acceptable performance. The following assumes a "standard" `Scripts.rxdata` to begin with; you will have to adapt similarly for your game.

### Event Loop

> **NOTE**: You may skip this step at the cost of performance and an uncontrolled framerate.

The event loop must be moved to the browser control. Add the following function globally in the last `Main` section. This function will be called by the browser for each animation frame.
```ruby
$prev_scene = nil
def main_update_loop
  if $scene != nil
    if $scene != $prev_scene
      if $prev_scene != nil
	      $prev_scene.dispose
      end
      $scene.main
      $prev_scene = $scene
    end
    # Update game screen
    Graphics.update
    # Update input information
    Input.update
    # Frame update
    $scene.update
  else
    raise "END"
  end
end
```

and **remove** the infinte loop so that control exits to the browser
```ruby
  while $scene != nil
    $scene.main
  end
```

For each "Scene", end the `main` initializer after the `Graphics.transition` call and add a dispose method to clean up. Remove the infinite loop. In effect, this amounts to replacing
```ruby
    loop do
      Graphics.update
      Input.update
      update
      if $scene != self
        break
      end
    end
```
with
```ruby
  end

  def dispose
```

Your final "Scene" script in RXMP might look like
```ruby
class Scene_Menu
    ...
    def main
        ...
        Graphics.transition
    end

    def dispose
        Graphics.freeze
        ...
    end

    def update
        ...
    end
end
```

### Save Games
Save games are stored in IndexedDB using [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage); you may expand on this to use a custom or cloud storage.

The title screen must not check if save files exist, as they may be loaded asynchronously. Just remove the check of file existence and always keep the Continue button enabled in `Scene_Title`.

Save files must be persisted to IndexedDB. To do this, call `save_file_async(filename)` after changing a save file. Also dump an extra `1` to the save file to work around some buggy Marshal behavior.

In standard RMXP scripts,
```ruby
class Scene_Save < Scene_File
    ...

    def on_decision(filename)
        ...

        file = File.open(filename, "wb")
        write_save_data(file)
        file.close

        save_file_async(filename)

        ...
    end

    def write_save_data(file)
        ...
        Marshal.dump(characters, file)
        ...
        Marshal.dump($game_player, file)
        ...
        Marshal.dump(1, file)
    end
end
```

### begin ... end until

This construct does not exist in mruby. The standard RXMP scripts use it in `Scene_Battle_3`. Remove all usages of this construct by replacing
```ruby
begin
    ...
end until condition
```

with
```ruby
loop do
    ...
    break if condition
end
```

### Audio and Graphics formats

Only OGG audio and PNG/JPEG images are supported. You can use `extra/convert_audio.sh` as a reference to quickly convert MIDI and WAV files to OGG (other formats such as MP3 can be handled similarly).

### Other Notes
* Refer to the `GAME_PROCESSING` section in `build.sh`. A folder named `gameasync` must contain all game files, which must be post processed.
* A file mapping must be generated for the filesystem to work properly, generated with `extra/make_mapping.sh`
* The same section also generates preload files for RMXP games. These files are used to preload assets when a map is loaded, and are generated by extracting all strings that refer to existing files from every map. Preload files are optional.
* Change the `namespace` variable in `index.html` if you are running multiple games on the same site. This variable is used to identify the game for save files in IndexedDB.
* Add a `.nojekyll` file to root directory if you are deploying to GitHub pages.
